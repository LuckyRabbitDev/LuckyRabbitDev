# 🐇 Oswaldo Crispim

**`Mobile Craftsman (IoT/Swift/Flutter)`**

I'm a Mobile Developer with a strong focus on building high-quality applications for iOS using Swift and SwiftUI, as well as cross-platform solutions with Flutter. My expertise spans IoT integration, object-oriented programming (OOP), and designing robust software architectures that ensure scalability, maintainability, and performance.

I follow best practices in version control, testing, and software development methodologies to create efficient and reliable applications. From ideation and planning to development, deployment, and publishing on the App Store, I take a comprehensive approach to delivering seamless user experiences.

I'm always looking to push the boundaries of mobile technology and build solutions that make a real impact.

 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Oswaldo's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
   I started my coding journey as a Computer Science student, with an insatiable curiosity for software development. My first steps were in Flutter, where I began shaping my understanding of mobile development. But it was when I discovered Swift that I truly found my passion—it just clicked.

Graduating in 2020 and now pursuing a post-graduate degree in Mobile Engineering, I’ve dedicated myself to building high-quality mobile applications from the ground up—ensuring they are not only functional but scalable and well-architected. From writing clean, maintainable code to deploying apps in the store, I take pride in every step of the process.

This journey has been about more than just coding—it’s about constantly evolving, pushing past comfort zones, and striving to build something meaningful. And I’m just getting started.
